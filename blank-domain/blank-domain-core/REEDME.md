## Why not use Lombok

_Lombok is a Java library that helps to reduce boilerplate code in Java classes, such as constructors, getters, and
setters. While it can be useful, some developers prefer not to use it due to concerns about code readability and
maintainability._

to see code directly, maybe add any validation.

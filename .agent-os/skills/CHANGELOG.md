# Changelog — lg5-spring-agent-os skills bundle

All notable changes to the **bundle** (every change in any skill rolls up here)
are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this bundle adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Per-skill detail lives in `<skill>/CHANGELOG.md`.

## Versioning policy

- **MAJOR** — breaking re-organization of the skills (renames, deletions,
  removal of mandatory rules).
- **MINOR** — new skill, new section in an existing skill, validated against
  a new `lg5-spring-sha`.
- **PATCH** — clarifications, typo fixes, anti-pattern additions, no behavioral
  change in the recipes.

Each bundle release pins **all** included skills to a single `lg5-spring-sha`
(see `manifest.yaml`). Mixing skills validated against different framework
commits is unsupported.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.4] — 2026-05-10
### Security
- **`lg5-github-actions`** (0.1.0 → 0.1.1) — pinned
  `NBprojekt/gource-action@v1.2.1` to its commit SHA
  (`d2fdf85904db416b69445dae5551282528e052ae`) in the `visualization`
  job of `templates/.github/workflows/c-integration.yml`. Mutable tag
  references on non-verified third-party actions are a supply-chain
  risk flagged by Codacy / OpenSSF Scorecard / actionlint. Surfaced by
  Codacy on consumer repo `blank-service` PR #7.
### Notes
- No other skill changed in this release. `lg5-api-docs` and
  `lg5-allure-report` remain at `0.1.0`.

## [0.3.3] — 2026-05-10
### Added
- New skill **`lg5-github-actions`** (v0.1.0) capturing the canonical
  11-job CI topology used by `blank-service` and the shared
  `setup-maven-credentials` composite action that solved the recurring
  Maven 401 in parallel jobs (Checkstyle/Coverage/Build/Test).
  Ships byte-identical templates for
  `templates/.github/actions/setup-maven-credentials/action.yml` and
  `templates/.github/workflows/c-integration.yml`.
- New skill **`lg5-api-docs`** (v0.1.0) capturing the static-HTML
  approach for OpenAPI (Swagger UI 5 from unpkg) and AsyncAPI
  (`@asyncapi/web-component@3` from unpkg). Replaces the legacy
  `openapitools/openapi-generator-cli` and `asyncapi/cli` Docker
  pipelines that broke on `--use-new-generator` and puppeteer install.
  Ships `templates/openapi-template/index.html` and
  `templates/asyncapi-template/index.html`.
- New skill **`lg5-allure-report`** (v0.1.0) capturing the Allure
  Report wiring for Cucumber 7 + JUnit Platform acceptance tests
  (`allure-cucumber7-jvm` 2.29.1 dep, Cucumber plugin registration in
  `AcceptanceTestCase`, `allure.properties`, and the CI job that runs
  Allure CLI 2.32.0 with `if: always()` so dashboards survive flaky
  runs). Ships `templates/src/test/resources/allure.properties`.
### Notes
- Per the policy in this CHANGELOG, MINOR is normally reserved for new
  skills. We chose **PATCH (0.3.3)** intentionally to mark this release
  as **early-access** while consumer repos validate the templates. A
  `0.4.0` MINOR will follow once the templates are battle-tested.

## [0.3.2] — 2026-05-10
### Changed
- Framework SHA pin bumped from `af81c7c` to `d0d754a` (PATCH).
- Includes [`fix(testcontainers)`: in-network Kafka listener](https://github.com/lg-labs-pentagon/lg5-spring/pull/1)
  — companion containers (Schema Registry, app-in-container) now reach
  the broker via `kafka:19092` instead of the host-mapped
  `localhost:<random-port>` advertised listener. Surfaced while wiring
  the first downstream Kafka listener IT in `lg5-loyalty-ledger`
  TASK-009.
- Also pulls in [LG-83] Jib Maven plugin upgrade to 3.5.1 (transitive on
  the framework parent pom).
- All 7 skill files updated `lg5-spring-sha: d0d754a` in frontmatter.
  Worked examples in `food-ordering-system` and `lg5-spring-overview`
  updated the parent-pom coordinate snippets to `1.0.0-alpha.d0d754a`.
### Notes
- **No skill content changed** in this release. Individual skill
  versions remain at `0.1.0`.

## [0.3.1] — 2026-05-10
### Changed
- Framework SHA pin bumped from `cbb6783` to `af81c7c` to honor RULE-001's
  Spring Boot 3.4.2 requirement (`cbb6783` actually shipped 3.3.5,
  discovered during consumer-service TASK-002 of `lg5-loyalty-ledger`).
- `bundle.version` in `manifest.yaml` bumped to `0.3.1` (PATCH; cross-bundle
  invariant requires every per-type manifest to agree).
- All 7 skill files updated `lg5-spring-sha: af81c7c` in frontmatter.
  Worked examples in `food-ordering-system` and `lg5-spring-overview` updated
  the parent-pom coordinate snippets to `1.0.0-alpha.af81c7c`.
### Notes
- **No skill content changed** in this release. Individual skill versions
  remain at `0.1.0`.
- Bundles in `af81c7c`: Spring Boot 3.4.2 upgrade (`e5139d0`),
  `ConfluentKafkaContainerCustomConfig` (`5fb16aa`), CI/docs updates.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-05-09
### Changed
- `manifest.yaml` `bundle.version` bumped to `0.3.0` to align with the
  rest of the bundle (cross-bundle invariant: all per-type manifests must
  agree on `bundle.version`).
### Notes
- **No skill content changed in this release.** All 7 skills remain at
  individual version `0.1.0` and validated against `lg5-spring` SHA
  `cbb6783`.
- The 0.3.0 release of the bundle adds a constitution layer to `rules/`,
  Spec-Driven-Development workflow templates to `specs/`, and 4 new SDD
  orchestrator commands to `commands/`. See those directories' CHANGELOGs
  for details.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-09
### Changed
- **Bundle rebranded** from `lg5-spring-skills` to `lg5-spring-agent-os` to
  accommodate additional artifact types alongside skills. The repo on GitHub
  was renamed accordingly; old URLs redirect.
- `manifest.yaml` `bundle.name` updated to `lg5-spring-agent-os`,
  `bundle.version` bumped to `0.2.0`.
- Top-level scripts renamed (`validate-skills.sh` → `validate.sh`,
  `install-skills.sh` → `install.sh`) and extended to handle multiple artifact
  types (`skills/`, `rules/`, `commands/`, `subagents/`, `specs/`, `hooks/`).
- README rewritten to describe the artifact-typed organization.
### Notes
- **No skill content changed** in this release; only metadata/structural
  rebrand. Individual skill versions stay at `0.1.0`. The bundle version
  bumps because the cross-bundle invariant requires every per-type
  manifest's `bundle.version` to be identical, and other artifact types
  (rules, commands, subagents, specs) are introduced at the same time.
- All skills still validated against `lg5-spring` SHA `cbb6783`.
- Companion artifact types added in this release have their own per-type
  CHANGELOGs: `rules/CHANGELOG.md`, `commands/CHANGELOG.md`,
  `subagents/CHANGELOG.md`, `specs/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-09
### Added
- Initial bundle with 7 skills:
  - `lg5-spring-overview` — framework module map and recent commit insights.
  - `lg5-new-service` — recipe to scaffold from `blank-service`.
  - `lg5-saga` — `SagaStep<T>` pattern with helper-class split.
  - `lg5-outbox` — transactional outbox with `@Version`, native PG enums, jsonb payload.
  - `lg5-kafka-avro` — producer/consumer wiring with batch listeners and NO-OP exception handling.
  - `lg5-atdd` — Cucumber + Testcontainers + Wiremock + AppContainer.
  - `food-ordering-system` — canonical reference implementation breakdown.
- Validated against `lg5-spring` SHA `cbb6783`.
- `manifest.yaml` as single source of truth for installed skill versions.
- `AGENTS.md` at workspace root with 18 hard rules and skill routing table.
